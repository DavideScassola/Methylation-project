### WGBS MSR comparison
The data is consists of two WGBS, one for H1 cells (https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR617FKV), and one from human stomach cells (https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR267SNS).

methylation rate on H1 cells: ~82% of CpG sites methylated

methylation rate on stomach cells: ~76% of CpG sites methylated



There is almost no difference in the plots of MSR calculated on h1 cells, stomach cells or simply the hypotetic situation in wich every CpG site is methylated, this is probably due to the common information that is due to the same positions of CpG sites, and to the fact that methylation rates of h1 and stomach cells are both high. I've done these experimets for several chromosomes.

In the case of MSR curves calculated on the contiguous list of CpG  sites (in this case I tried both on CpG sites of chromosome 1 and on CpG sites of the whole genome), there is a small difference that is probably due simply to the differece in methylation rates.
