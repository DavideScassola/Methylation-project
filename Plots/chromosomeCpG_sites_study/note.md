## Study of the CpG sites in the Genome

The two plots were generated applying the MSR algorithm to a binary string in which the ith element is 1 if it's a CpG site (more precisely the position of the C), 0 otherwise.
The part of the genome is the chromosome 1 of a mouse (mm10), the percentage of CpG sites is of about 0.77%.
