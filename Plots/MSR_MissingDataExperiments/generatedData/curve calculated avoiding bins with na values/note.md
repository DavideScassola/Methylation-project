In some resolution vs relevance plots, the continuous vertical line is the proportion of available data actually used to calculate the couple (relevance,resolution).

In bin_size vs relevance plots, or bin_size vs resolution_plots, the countinuous line is the proportion of available data actually used to calculate the relevance-resolution for a certain bin size.
